Cloudinary - Used together with MondoDB, user upload their images and is stored via cloudinary URL

UUID - The UUID generated by uuid() ensures that each filename generated for uploaded files will be unique. This prevents naming conflicts when multiple files are uploaded at the same time or rapid succession

BCRYPT - generates a random salt (a unique value) to securely hash password.
       - Ensures that two same passwords will be given different hash value
